The user places a filter holder, fills the filter with coffee grounds, and slides the filter holder into its receptacle.
The user then pours up to 12 cups of water into the water strainer and presses the "Brew" button.

If the pot is removed from the warmer plate while coffee is sprayed over grounds, the flow of water is stopped, so that brewed coffee does not spill on the warmer plate.
